<blockquote><p>&#8220;Living the Lessons, by far the best book I&#8217;ve yet read on proven strategies for developing a values-based curriculum, is a vital resource for all who desire to create a classroom of the heart as well as the mind.&#8221;<br />
-<strong>Guy Doud</strong>, 1987 National Teacher of the Year</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>From the Author-</strong><br />
<em>Living the Lessons</em> is the compelling drama of a determined teacher on a lofty quest: to learn to value every single one of her students—beyond a galaxy of stars! In a practical sense, it chronicles my philosophy of education: the Whole Child approach. If you are earnestly seeking ways to meet the social, emotional, intellectual and moral needs of the children in your life, please join with me.</p>
<p><em>Living the Lessons</em> stands inexorably on the premise espoused by Saint Augustine, who believed that, &#8220;The value of a single child surpasses that of a galaxy of stars!&#8221; Long ago I happened upon his words in a book and was shaken to my very soul. Hauntingly, it seemed that Augustine was calling out to me from centuries gone by, gently urging me to examine my heart.</p>
<p>Clutching the book in my hands, I wept penitent tears as the bitter truth clamored for disclosure: Not only did I not value my students as Augustine exhorted, but I had favorites! The full truth be told, I had never even remotely considered the notion that I should value my students to such a degree.</p>
<p>On that pivotal day I solemnly vowed to change my course, and my life since has never been the same. Every moment of every day in the classroom I hold myself strictly accountable to that pledge. Understandably—especially considering today&#8217;s troubled times—choosing to follow Augustine&#8217;s calling has not been the easy path.</p>
<p>But despite the many times I have missed the mark with my students, each year, without exception, the path to loving children unconditionally grows less and less wearisome. Because I am learning to wholly value my students, I am, after thirty-seven years in the classroom, more enthusiastic than ever before.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Available for Purchase September 15th!</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><br />
Starry-eyed young entrepreneurs often ask me, “What’s the formula for success?” After they hear whom I’ve worked for and the companies I&#8217;ve developed, they want the holy grail of business—extraordinary financial wealth. Each walks away dejected when I frankly admit, “There’s no formula.”</strong></p>
<p>As a boy, I made a misguided vow that propelled me into becoming an “ice man” in the corporate world, a man who didn’t care for anything but his own advancement. I was a high level executive manager at General Mills, PepsiCo, Frito Lay, Taco Bell, and Disney. I helped build a company worth billions (MFS), and was a founder of another (Level 3 Communications) worth over 100 billion. In fact, the Internet largely sits on that company&#8217;s infrastructure. But at the height of my career, tragedy struck . . . and a terrible, wonderful decision had to be made.</p>
<p>If you want to understand the underlying core values of success, my journey will assist you. If you have been debilitated by pain, my story will bring comfort. If you are an executive that thrives on business but are thirsting for <em>more</em>, this book may be your story as well. I can&#8217;t give you the formula for success, but I can show you how to live a life of relentless purpose . . . which may or may not include profound wealth.</p>
